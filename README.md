Build a new Flask application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page.

When you build this, please make sure that your program meets the following criteria:

http://localhost:5000 - have this display a nice looking HTML form.  The form should be submitted to '/process'.

Save form data into session.

http://localhost:5000/result - have this display a html with the information that was submitted by POST
